# YT-SubPals-bot
A simple bot to automate the process on SubPals
What's this?

SubPals is a website which offers you to like and subscribe 20 youtube videos, and you will get 10 new subscribers (it works).

I created a bot using Python and Selenium that completes the task for us.

Register manually at Subpals and then you will be able to run my bot.

REQUIREMENTS: Selenium, Chrome Webdriver.

[+] How to get Selenium? --- Open the cmd and run "pip install selenium"

[+] How to get Chrome Webdriver? --- You can download it from here : https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads.

TO DO'S:

1. To create a profile

    1.Create a folder on your computer, say C:\chrome-dev-profile. This folder will hold the data for the new profile.

    2.Make a copy of the Google Chrome shortcut on your desktop. (Right-click, then Copy.) Name the new shortcut something like Chrome Development.

    3.Right-click the Chrome Development shortcut, choose Properties, and paste --user-data-dir=C:\chrome-dev-profile at the end of the Target field. The result might look like this:"C:\Documents and Settings\me\Local Settings\Application Data\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --user-data-dir=c:\chrome-dev-profile

    4.Start Google Chrome by double-clicking the Chrome Development shortcut. This creates the profile data. 

2.Insert Your channel ID.

3.Insert Your channel Password.

Note: Make sure ChromeDriver is in the same folder as the script.

Then you can run and enjoy with your new subscribers!
